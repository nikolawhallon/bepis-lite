# bepis-lite

This branch of bepis-lite demonstrates how you can add items to a menu on the back-end server, and use that information in the front-end client
when interfacing with Deepgram STS. It also expands on the numbers of endpoints useful for function calling with the ability to add items, remove items,
clear whole orders, get the status of an order, etc. The server part of this project is currently deployed at:

The architecture is explained more in the `main` branch, but I'll include here again the following diagram:
